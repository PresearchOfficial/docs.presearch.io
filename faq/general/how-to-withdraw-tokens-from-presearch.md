# How to withdraw tokens from Presearch

With the advent of Web3 withdrawals, we are excited to enable our users unencumbered access to all node rewards, user deposited tokens and PRE purchased on the Presearch Platform. Although search rewards will still need to go through a manual review process for some users,  users who search normal (aren't trying to farm tokens from searching) won't have any issues removing their search reward tokens.

If you're looking for how to claim your search rewards token, click the link to the page below!

If you have tokens you've purchased on the marketplace, PRE deposited from the blockchain or rewards from nodes, we'll walk you step by step for how you can take your PRE off of the platform in just a few minutes.

## Web3 Withdrawl Process

First things first, head to [https://account.presearch.com/withdrawals](https://account.presearch.com/withdrawals) and select the number of tokens you'd like to withdraw and the wallet address you'd like to send the funds to. When everything looks good, click Withdraw. Make sure that the wallet address is either a Metamask wallet, or some other form of wallet where you can sign transactions. **Withdrawing directly to exchanges will not work**. Make sure to have sufficient ETH in the wallet in which you are sending your PRE to. To estimate costs, check current [network congestion & gas costs](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

If you've recently un-staked tokens, you'll need to wait the 24hr lockup period before you can withdraw tokens.

### Once you click confirm, an email will be sent to you.&#x20;

Head over to your email to confirm the withdrawl. This is to protect you in case your account is compromised at any time, so that tokens are not able to be withdrawn.

### Once your wallet is connected, click confirm withdrawal.

Be cautious, as this will be your last opportunity to cancel your withdrawal. If you do not wish to proceed with the withdrawal at this point, cancel your withdrawal.
