## If you're sharing with your friend who is unfamiliar with blockchain/crypto:

Go to [https://presearch.com/account/referrals](https://presearch.com/account/referrals) & share your referral link from there. It should look like: [https://presearch.com/signup?rid=109792](https://presearch.com/signup?rid=109792)



## **If you want to send them right to the search engine:**

Copy & paste referral code at the end of the search engine like this [https://presearch.com/?rid=10979 ](https://presearch.com/?rid=10979)so that you will be rewarded for anyone you send here who creates an account.

## If you're a search engine and need to pass a query:

Copy & paste referral code at the end of the search engine like this [https://engine.presearch.com/search?q=presearch+rocks&?rid=10979](https://engine.presearch.com/search?q=presearch+rocks&?rid=10979) so that you get rewarded when anyone who searches through your engine creates an account.
