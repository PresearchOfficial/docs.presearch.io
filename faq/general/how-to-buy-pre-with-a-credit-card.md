## How to Buy with a Credit Card

### Set up Metamask

## **There are 2 ways of completing the transaction.**&#x20;

### **1. Using the Presearch marketplace**

* The first is to initiate a purchase on the Presearch marketplace [https://marketplace.presearch.com/](https://marketplace.presearch.com/) for Ether.&#x20;
* You then copy the amount of Ether needed and paste it in your notes. Then click complete purchase.

* You then copy and paste your "transfer to Wallet Address" in the presearch marketplace to the "your ETH address" text input in Wyre

* Then initiate the transaction, making sure there is enough to pay for [Gas Fees](https://etherscan.io/gastracker). If you don't have enough for gas, you may have to initiate another purchase.

* The PRE tokens will then be added to your PRE account after you purchase, as the ETH is sent directly to Presearch.

### 2. Using Uniswap

* Instead of changing the ethereum address, you keep it the same and complete your purchase on Wyre.
* Once the ETH arrives in your account, head to [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) and connect your Metamask wallet.&#x20;

* Convert your ETH for PRE tokens and sign the contracts to swap the tokens. Make sure to save enough ETH to send the PRE tokens on the blockchain to your account.
* Open up [https://keywords.presearch.com/transfer-tokens/blockchain](https://keywords.presearch.com/transfer-tokens/blockchain) on your Presearch account. Copy the address

* Open up Metamask - you should see your PRE tokens in there. If you don't, scroll to the bottom and click add custom token. Put in 0xEC213F83defB583af3A000B1c0ada660b1902A0F as the token contract
* Once you see your tokens, click on the "send" button

* Once you click on send, paste the address you copied from [https://keywords.presearch.com/transfer-tokens/blockchain](https://keywords.presearch.com/transfer-tokens/blockchain) & send the tokens.
