# What Wallets accept PRE?

Presearch rewards users with PRE tokens when they search.

Once users collect 1,000 eligible PRE, they can withdraw those tokens to an external blockchain wallet to hold their rewards securely in their own custody.

To help you store your PRE in your own outside wallet, we’ve compiled an ever-growing list of wallets that support the Presearch PRE token:

In order to add your PRE to your wallet, you’ll need to add an Ethereum token.

You should then receive a wallet address you can send your PRE to.

Once you have that address, visit the [withdrawals section of your Presearch.com account](https://account.presearch.com/withdrawals), enter your new wallet address into the field provided.
