# What can I use my tokens for?

Tokens are primarily used for keyword staking (advertising) and node staking (operating nodes) . Presearch also rewards members with tokens for searching through Presearch and for referring new active members. Tokens can also be transferred off of the Presearch platform and help in cryptocurrency wallets and bought or sold on some cryptocurrency exchanges.
