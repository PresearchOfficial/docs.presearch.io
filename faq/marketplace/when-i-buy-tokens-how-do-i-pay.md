# When I buy tokens, how do I pay?

Payments can be made via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Credit Card, and USD through wire transfer or email money transfer in Canada. If you choose to pay via wire transfer, you must agree to pay the bank wire fees. Wire payments received without fees paid may be rejected, and/or have bank fees deducted from the overall payment amount, decreasing the number of PREs you receive.
