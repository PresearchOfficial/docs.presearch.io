# Can I already run a Presearch node?

Each registered user can access its [node dashboard ](https://nodes.presearch.com/dashboard)and deploy a Presearch node anytime they wish. General steps to setup a node can be found [here](../setup.md).

We also suggest you join the [Presearch Nodes Telegram group](https://t.me/PresearchNodes) or [Presearch discord server](https://discord.presearch.io) for communication of any updates from our development team and for help and support from a community of thousands of other nodes operators.

Join at [https://t.me/PresearchNodes](https://t.me/PresearchNodes) or [https://discord.presearch.io/](https://discord.presearch.io/)
