# Can I run Presearch node besides Flux node ?

Flux node can actually host a Presearch node. So due to that there is no support for hosting together Flux and Presearch node on same public IPv4 address / same host.

> **Note:** If you run those two together it can happen anytime that your node logs could be filled up with _Duplicate node_ statements
