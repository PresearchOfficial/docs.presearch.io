# Running a node on Akash

First things first, get your Akash environment set up. We recommend downloading the [Akashlytics deployment desktop application](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deploy/akashlytics-deploy-installation). Select MacOS, Window OS or Linux OS and wait for it to download. This assumes you've already created your Presearch account and can access [nodes.presearch.com](https://nodes.presearch.com)

**Step 1 - Create wallet**&#x20;

Once Akashlytics has finished downloading, open the desktop app and follow the instructions for setting up. You can either import an existing wallet, or create a new one.

* In the tool you can choose a name for this wallet. This will not affect the functionality of the tool but is just an easy way to track what wallet is currently in use.
* Next choose a password that you will remember for the wallet.

_Note: The funds available in the pre-existing wallet instance should now be available to Akashlytics and displayed in the upper left corner of the application (52.943 AKT in the provided example)_

#### Step 2 - Certificate Creation

When first launching the tool there will not be a valid certificate.  To fix this select the ellipsis to the right of the Certificate status and click “Create Certificate”.

* Make sure that you have sufficient $AKT to push the deployment. If you don't have sufficient AKT, you can purchase from one of these [markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/akash-network/markets/).
