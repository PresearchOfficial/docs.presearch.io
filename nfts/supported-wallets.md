# Supported Wallets

Occasionally, Presearch releases NFTs on its platform. Some are given away for free to community members, and some (in the future) may be available for sale for certain benefits or utility.

In order to be considered for any NFT drops, you will need to connect your Web3 wallet on the Presearch NFT Wallet page at [https://presearch.com/account/nft-wallet](https://presearch.com/account/nft-wallet).

Whenever you connect your wallet, the latest wallet you've connected will be linked to your Presearch account, and will be used for any future NFT drops for which you may be eligible.
