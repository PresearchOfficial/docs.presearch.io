# How to use AI

To activate the AI within the search engine, users will need to meet the 1k PRE token requirement. It also helps to maintain the security and stability of the platform, as it ensures that users have a vested interest in the responsible use of Presearch AI.



**Procedure for using AI**

If you run a query longer than 2 words - ex. [https://presearch.com/search?q=what+is+bitcoin%3F](https://presearch.com/search?q=what+is+bitcoin%3F) - you should see the AI results at the top of your query.

We had it running for every query, but it wasn't relevant a lot of the time - not enough context.
