# Buy with Credit Card

## Getting Started

If you're a crypto pro, and already have your stack of Sats or Vitalik bucks, head over to our [exchange page](https://presearch.io/exchanges) where you can see all the exchanges the Presearch is listed on! If you're new to crypto, or just want to Purchase PRE with a credit card, this is the right place for you!

### Setting up your wallet.

There are many different wallets that you can use to buy PRE with a credit card. The two main ones are [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) & [My](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)[EtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/)&#x20;

If you've never set up a wallet before, watch a video for how to setup [Metamask on Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af\_lQ1zUnoM), or [MyEtherWallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nnhPXTk3mo) on mobile. You will be able to purchase with a credit card on either, and we will walk you through the steps on both.

## Metamask

Once you've got your Metamask wallet all setup and secured your sercret phrase, open your wallet and click Buy.
