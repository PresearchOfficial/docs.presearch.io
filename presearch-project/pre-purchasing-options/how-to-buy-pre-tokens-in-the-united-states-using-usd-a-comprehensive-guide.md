**Before You Begin:** Make sure you are logged into your [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) account and your [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) extension is installed on the same browser. If you haven’t yet installed MetaMask, Go to [_How to install Metamask_](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531) to do so for various browsers: Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox.

1\. **Open MetaMask:** Open your MetaMask either as a browser extension or through its webpage app. Click on the “Buy” button. This will prompt you to select your country and state. (Note: Residents from all U.S. states are eligible except Hawaii).

2\. **Purchasing ETH:** You’ll first need to purchase ETH tokens (or a fraction thereof) which will be swapped for PRE tokens later.

3\. **Select ETH Quantity:** Choose the amount of ETH you wish to buy, in USD.

**Pro Tip:** Always leave at least $20 of ETH in your MetaMask wallet to cover future transaction (gas) fees.

4\. **Choose Payment Method:** In the dropdown options, select PayPal and then click “Buy with PayPal”. If this is your first crypto purchase with PayPal, you’ll be prompted to provide additional information.

5\. **Complete Payment:** After entering the requested information, click “Buy with PayPal” again. If PayPal does not auto-redirect you, manually select this option on the MetaMask web app.

6\. **Review and Edit:** Should you wish to change the amount you’re purchasing, simply close the review pop-up and adjust the quantity in MetaMask.

Coinbase Wallet is one of the most convenient ways to [Purchase Presearch](https://www.coinbase.com/price/presearch?utm\_campaign=rt\_i\_m\_w\_m\_acq\_ugc\_soc\_0\_asset\&utm\_source=ugc\&utm\_platform=iOS) in general and especially in the United States. Coinbase Wallet is a function easily accessible to all Coinbase account holders and can be accessed directly from your Coinbase account easily by selecting the icon.

The method Coinbase Wallet uses is the Swap function, so, you will need to have some ETH in your wallet to use as gas fees (transaction fee) **and** an asset to swap from to PRE. That asset can be any Erc20 token, including ETH, just remember that if you swap ETH to PRE, leave a little ETH in your wallet for gas fees next time.
