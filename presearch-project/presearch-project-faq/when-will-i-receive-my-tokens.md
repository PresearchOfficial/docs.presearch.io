  How long does it take to receive token deposits from external wallet or
  exchange

# When will I receive my tokens?

Tokens will show in your PRE account immediately upon depositing PRE from external wallet or exchange to your Presearch account deposit address over ETH network with at least 20 confirmation of transaction.&#x20;

This is typically processed over 30 minutes or less but it could take up to several hours depending on the network conditions.

To send Pre from an external wallet or exchange to your presearch page (PRE Wallet) you must do it through the following link.

{% embed url="https://keywords.presearch.com/transfer-tokens/blockchain" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please beware that network transaction has to be successfully executed on chain, pending state of transaction is counted as waiting for execution of transfer. You can check the state of your transaction on etherscan.io with TRX hash you receive from exchange or web3 wallet.
{% endhint %}
